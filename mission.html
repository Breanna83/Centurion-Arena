    <h1> Our Mission     
    <p> With this game, we hope to create a new and fun way to exercise. We feel there has been a stigma in the gaming community. People think gaming and they think of 
    staring in front of a screen all day, ruining your brain and eyes. This is not true. We hope this game helps to disprove that. Our game involves a lot of physical movement.
    It takes excercise and gaming, and makes it into one. A fun, new way to game.
    </p>
