        <p>
            Hi, Im Bre Im a game designer who likes video games a little to much. Some of my faves are Genshin Impact, Valorant, and Splatoon. 
            I grew up around video games so im proud to say that I've played AND beat more than 100. What makes me passonite is the magical escape 
            aspect of games. I could boot up Splaton and not have a care for the next 6 hours. If I ever have a hard day then I know I could go play 
            valorant and feel better. My favorite types of games are ones with good combat mechanics. I do enjoy my fair share of peacefull vibes from 
            genshin but nothing can compare ti the feelings that come from the rush of fighting a difficult boss and the feeling of victory that you get
            when you beat it.
