            Hi, Im Bre Im a game designer who likes video games a little to much. Some of my faves are Genshin Impact, Valorant, and Splatoon. 
            I grew up around video games so im proud to say that I've played AND beat more than 100. What makes me passonite is the magical escape 
            aspect of games. I could boot up Splaton and not have a care for the next 6 hours. If I ever have a hard day then I know I could go play 
            valorant and feel better. My favorite types of games are ones with good combat mechanics. I do enjoy my fair share of peacefull vibes from 
            genshin but nothing can compare ti the feelings that come from the rush of fighting a difficult boss and the feeling of victory that you get
            when you beat it.
        </p>
        <h2><center> What it means to Game </h2>
        <p class="p1"> 
           In googles words, the word "game" means: "a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, 
           strength, or luck." And while that may be the true definition it doesn't stick with me. So MY definition of game would be "whatever you wnat it
           to be". A game can litteraly be anything which is the true beauty of gaming. Now, it may seem like a cop out answer but in my defence people 
           say that life is a game thus proving my point that anything can be a game.
